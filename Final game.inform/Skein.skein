You&apos;re in Rivet City, the city made in an old aircraft carrier. Pretty good place after the nuclear holocaust. The goal is to find a scientist known as Pinkerton who has barricaded himself in the lower half of the ship. He knows the history of this city and you&apos;re job is to find out more about it. In order to get to him you&apos;re going to have to go through the bow. There seems to be a mysterious old door to the south, better check that out first.

Hotel
There seems to be an old caretaker and a robbot butler named &quot;Mr Gusty&quot;

On the counter are a Stimpak x 0 and Shades.

Seems senile… Talking to her won浡摥∠牍䜠獵祴ਢ&apos;t do any good.

He says &quot;How may I help you sir?&quot; but doesn&apos;t seem to know anything.

You can also see Bomb kit here.
